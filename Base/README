These files compile with only a warning message in one file
that is probably a bug in gcc 4.
There are a number of undefined symbols that are mainly to SPARC
specific code that has been removed.

Changes
I copied common/*.c into new directory D.
I did gcc -Wmost *.c
For each missing .h file I copied it and its directory mates into D.
I added missing break at end of switch statement in domainc.c
I changed "#include <scsi/scsi.h>" to "#include "scsi.h"" in devmdh.h
I then deleted scsi.h since:
  it had (c) by Sun, 
  it had undocumented pragma "ident"
  it seemed at best a stub for <scsi/scsi_types.h>
I made a new scsi.h; see comments there.
I added "#include "consmdh.h"" to dsks.c
I elaborate definitions in scsi.h as gcc tells me I must.
------
I am renaming files ending in ".h" as ".hs" if they are copyrighted by Sun.
Most are unneeded.
I am renaming .c files beginning "_del-" to end in .co .
I rename iommu.c to iommu.co for we are unlikely to encounter a machine
  with an iommu like the old SPARCs.
iommunex.c has become iommunex.co for the same reason. It is DMA savvy.
I am prepending "// " to "#include" lines calling for such files.
I have changed prom_printf to printf.

I have renamed esp.c to esp.cs since I think this is Sun code despite lack of a copyright statement.
In any case I think we are not now in a position to use SCSI code.

main.c seems designed to run in a user environment to produce an ELF file
and use the shared libelf routines.
These routines are originally by Sun, I think.
<http://directory.fsf.org/libs/misc/libelf.html> is a description of an
open source version.
Is it worthwhile to tye ourselves to a particular loader format just for loading the kernel?
I rename main.c as main.cu on this account.
At this time (2005 Aug 7) there are still header files copyrighted by Sun among those included in out .c files.
There are fewer than there were.
Many small changes have been made to accomodate the sensibilities of gcc 4.
"gcc -Wmost *.c" produces relatively few warnings and most of those have to do with Sun hardware.

There are several files ending in .cu that are merely alternative files.
These cause symbol collisions witn "gcc *.c". "ld" then barfs.
.c files not mentioned in jamfiles were renammed .cx files.

With gcc together with ld, on the Mac, there are several symbols that seem efectively reserved.
Among these are sprintf, memset, Memcpy, malloc and several beginning "str".
I have capatilized these to escape from this confusion.

I made a little more headway in replacing llic function with native 64 bit.
