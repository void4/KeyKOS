<title>Kernel Logic, Past and Prospect</title>
The kernel design has changed little since <a href=http://cap-lore.com/CapTheory/KK/m/kernel-logic.html>that of the 370 kernel</a>.
But not a line of code remains from that kernel which was written in 370 assembler.
All assembly code for the new system is specific to some modern CPU.
I tentatively adopt “base” in place of “the kernel” as it seems to improve the flow of text.
<p>The new base runs privileged and unswapped.
Whether base runs mapped depends on the specific processor and whether the <a href=http://cap-lore.com/CapTheory/PrivMap.html>RAP</a> can be avoided.
There are no provisions for base code to be introduced while the system runs.
I resist such provisions for now.
<p>The 370 ran with interrupts disabled but that was partly a figment of the 370 architecture.
370 IO channels ran concurrently with the CPU and on some models <a href=http://cap-lore.com/Hardware/IO.html#breakin>that IO logic was indeed performed by the same micro engine that executed the 370 instructions</a> in which base was expressed.
Modern systems may require that the CPU perform corresponding intermediate steps of the channel programs in which case interrupts for performing such IO actions will be enabled.
The separation of base state from state of the “virtual channel process” remains a design principle.
The base state remains logically isolated from the states of “channel programs”.
<h3>Starting Base</h3>
The SPARC version of base was placed in RAM thru tftp, which was a temporary debugging hack.
I describe the steps here but do not recommend them.
The SPARC ROM code was reminiscent of Open Boot and would place base at low core addresses of its choosing.
As our code gained control a reconnaissance routine would first process the clues left by the ROM code, especially to find the real (bus) addresses available to base and its guests.
A more advanced version of this might conditionally load alternative drivers depending on other optional system components.
<p>The 370 kernel booted from the disk into real addresses.
First a block of code came into low RAM and this code copied the kernel into real addresses that had been assigned as the kernel was built in the development environment.
370 hardware guaranteed contiguous real memory starting at 0.
The 370 channel architecture made base oblivious to all device details except for a few details about the disks from which it was to reanimate a checkpoint, swap and produce new checkpoints.
The logic necessary for particular types of IO devices was outside base.
There was also some confusion about channel addresses led to which classes of device.
Other operating systems for the 370 had similar confusion.

<h3>More Detail</h3>
This is some information that might be useful for porting to a 32 bit SPARC.
An ELF file was produced by program kernel/make_bootable_image.cx which relied on libelf from Sun.
This file included the code for base and the micro_loader.
File kernel/micro_loader.sx is a SPARC assembler program to perform the reconnaissance referred to above.
It runs immediately after the boot ROM has transferred it and base to the RAM of the SPARC.
I hope this code is never needed again.
It is painfully savvy of: the address space inherited from the boot ROM, the real addresses and the address space it is building for base.
<br>It interprets the set of real addresses at which RAM can be accessed,
<br>Verifies assumptions about what addresses are functional and available,
<br>Builds an optimized map so that base, which runs mapped on the SPARC, puts minimal load on the TLB (big pages),
<br>Allocates a few ranges of virtual addresses for base storage.
<br>Leaves a few crumbs of information (Missive) for base (mostly addresses),
<br>Turns on the new map.
<br>Abdicates in favor of base (go to m_kernelEntryAddress).
<p>The program in main.cu is an ordinary C program to be run in a Unix environment where it has access to .o files for base and domain programs.
It builds an ELF file for a big bang.
<h3>Chatty Kernels</h3>
I think kernels should not speak any natural language.
They should interface to programs on one side and be the subject of debuggers on the other.
However we did not invest in a debugger stub for the SPARC.
We relied instead on base emitting error message and commentary over a rudimentary ascii start-stop uart.
Upon panic RAM would be slowly copied back to a Solaris system to be examined as a corpse by gdb.
There is a rudimentary printf style formatting routine in base whose sole
purpose is emit blow by blow commentary elicited by certain debugging switches in lo-core.
This would be better served by construction where base is the proper subject of a debugger such as gdb.
<h3>Make and Jam</h3>
Halfway thru the SPARC project we switched from <tt>make</tt> to <a href=http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html>Jam</a> by <a href=http://www.perforce.com/>Perforce</a> and that was a big productivity boost, mainly due to rebuild times.
The .c and .h sources for base were in a directory tree that was designed to reflect the parts of the kernel which were processor dependent and system dependent.
There were two faults in this:
<br>as we mapped base files into this tree a number of errors were made
and our source control package had obscure semantics regarding moving a file within a tree,
<br>basic tools, such as <tt>grep</tt> were hard to use.
<p>I think my productivity was greatly reduced by the later problem and this release delivers sources for base in a flat directory.
The .c and .h files for the kernel are in the same directory.
For now source files for programs auxiliary to base are in that directory but with peculiar file types.
These auxiliary programs do not run in the kernel’s address space.
I have not decided how to release the source for domain code.
The current tree structure seems appropriate there.
